Dynamic Programming :

1. Memoization

2. Tabulation


Memoization Way :

1. Make it work :
- visualize the problem as a tree
- implement the tree using recursion
- test it
2. Make it Efficient :
- add a memo object
- add a base c case to return memo value
- store return value into the memo


Tabulation Way :

- visualize the problem as a table
- size the table based on inputs
- initialize the table based on inputs
- seed the trivial answer into the table (base cases)
- iterate through the table
- fill further positions based on current position
